# Game Client
## Description
I need to do a lot of things yet, like a collision system. The base of the items is already done, I just need to finish that to get a complete base to the items (resource meteorite, for exemple). The general connection to the server (in this case, firebase) has already done as well. Menu are almost ok and HUD need to be implemented.
That's it. I'll stay a while without computer. So, when I got a computer again, I will finish this little project :)
